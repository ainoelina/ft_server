# ft_server
ft_server was a project where I created a web server with ```Nginx``` that ran ```WordPress``` website, ```phpMyAdmin```, and a ```MySQL``` database. The server was set up to run in only Docker container built on Debian Buster. </br>
The project was the first introduction to system administration, and taught a lot about docker technology and setting up a web server.
